# MQTT-ESPGate: Retrofit Solution for Gate Control Boards

Welcome to the ESPGate repository! This project offers a comprehensive retrofit solution tailored to upgrade a variety of gate control boards. Leveraging the power of MQTT and ESP8266 modules, this solution provides seamless control over gate automation systems. The repository hosts the design files and documentation for a specialized PCB crafted specifically for this purpose, ensuring easy integration and enhanced functionality for existing gate control setups.

## Project Description

The project aims to upgrade existing automatic gates by adding advanced control and monitoring features. The provided PCB is designed to be integrated into the control boards of installed gates, providing a standardized interface for adding new functionalities without the need to replace the entire system.

## Key Features

- **Remote Commands**: The PCB allows sending remote commands to the gate, enabling opening, closing, and other programmable actions.
- **Status Monitoring**: It's possible to read the current status of the gate, including open, closed signals, and error states.
- **Addition of Clean Contact**: The option to add a clean contact is provided, allowing integration with external control systems or safety devices.

## Repository Structure

- `design/`: Contains PCB design files, including schematics and layouts.
- `docs/`: Additional project documentation.
- `examples/`: Code examples for interfacing with the PCB.
- `LICENSE`: Project license.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

### Hardware

- **Opening and Closing Contacts**: The opening and closing contacts present on the gate control board are essential for sending opening and closing commands through our PCB.
- **Indicator Light (optional)**: If available, the indicator light provides visual feedback on the gate's status. In cases where the indicator light is not available, the clean contact already present on our PCB can be used to connect a sensor that detects the gate's open or closed status.

### Software

- **WiFi Connection**: A WiFi connection is required to facilitate communication between the PCB and the MQTT broker, as well as for any configuration operations via mobile devices or computers.
- **MQTT Broker**: An MQTT broker must be available and running, acting as an intermediary for communication between the PCB and other devices or services.

These hardware and software requirements are essential to ensure the proper and reliable operation of the gate control system through the PCB.
